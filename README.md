# Analysis of Human Microbiome for NGS and TGS
## Core Laboratory of Human Microbiome @ Taipei Medical University
In collaboration with Professor Chee-kin Then

This repository contains
### python
1) QIIME2 pipeline to process fastq reads to create qiime2 artefacts, visualisation artefacts, as well as custom plots of microbial population taxa diversity
### R
2) YCL6 pipeline adapted from the work of I-Hsuan Lin, whose work can be found [here](https://github.com/ycl6/16S-rDNA-V3-V4). This creates phyloseq object, trains phylogenetic trees de novo, and makes custom plots of microbial population taxa diversity
